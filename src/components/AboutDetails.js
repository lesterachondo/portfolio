        <h2>So, who am I?</h2>
        <p>Hello, I’m Lester, a full-stack web developer with a strong foundation in front-end and back-end development. I have hands-on experience with core web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m passionate about creating responsive, user-friendly websites and applications.</p>
        <p>On the front end, I’ve worked with frameworks like React, where I’ve started building dynamic user interfaces and incorporating component-based architecture to create efficient, maintainable code. I’m always looking to expand my knowledge of React and dive deeper into more advanced features like state management, hooks, and lifecycle methods.</p>
        <p>On the back end, I have experience with server-side technologies like PHP and working with databases such as MySQL and Oracle. I’ve built several full-stack applications, handling both the client-side and server-side aspects, which has given me a solid understanding of how to structure applications and ensure smooth integration between front-end and back-end components.</p>
        <p>I am committed to continue in learning and improving my skills, whether it’s keeping up with new features in React or mastering back-end technologies. Collaboration is important to me, and I enjoy working closely with designers and other developers to bring ideas to life. I’m always open to feedback and thrive in environments where I can contribute, learn, and grow.</p>
        <p>Let’s connect and build something great together!</p>
