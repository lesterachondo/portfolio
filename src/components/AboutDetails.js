        <h2>So, who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          I’m Lester, a full-stack web developer with expertise in both front-end and back-end development. My career began when I earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Caloocan City, where I gained skills in both hardware and software.        </p>
        <p>
          I started my career as a field service engineer, providing technical solutions for machines like POS systems and data servers. Later, I moved into an IT engineer role in an office, where I gained experience in management and technical tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          I then transitioned to a junior web developer role, where I deepened my knowledge on core web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On the front end, I worked with React to build dynamic user interfaces and learned how to create efficient, maintainable code using component-based architecture. I am eager to expand my React knowledge, particularly with advanced features like state management, hooks, and lifecycle methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the back end, I have experience with PHP and databases like MySQL and Oracle. I’ve built full-stack applications, handling both client-side and server-side tasks, which has helped me understand how to structure applications and integrate front-end and back-end components seamlessly.
        </p>
        <p>I’m always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer, and I’m excited to continue building applications that make a meaningful impact.</p>
